- 👋 Hi, I’m Ojasv (/odʒʌsw/). Puzzled by the wire-less functioning of TV, FM, Walkie-Talkie, Cellphone, Satellites...
      I opted to explore telecommunication engineering after completing schooling, and by the time I actually graduated, I chose to be a Software Engineer.
      I've worked with various computer languages starting from HTML, SQL, C++ in school to C, 8051 and 8085 Assembly, MatLab during engineering, 
      to currently IBM CL, RPG and JavaScript at work. Out of my assorted aspirations, one is to be a kick-ass product architect.
- 👀 PC has intrigued me since I first used it to play Super Mario (2004), thereafter 
      It was fun to play-around with CMD prompt and shell-script to better understand the machine's working. I design and develop business apps now.
- 🌱 I like to read about system softwares, and wish to design and build an OS from scratch one day. Not to forget, a language compiler as well (high hopes? IK) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing simple & robust solutions for sophisticated problems (preferably open-source)
